Django makes up the backbone of this project. with its well organised structure sites can be quickly built and deployed. It is one of many python extensions by
by far it is the best one in my current opionion for web site development.

contrabutions:

used some of the lessons i have done on django as an example of how my code for this project should look like.

found how to do pie charts in JavaScript from <a href="https://www.anychart.com/blog/2017/12/06/pie-chart-create-javascript/">this site.</a>
reused the code in there how to example but made changes to suite my needs all rights to the code still belong to anychart.com 

The address used as the charity's office is an empty office space found on zoopla.com this was chosen as to not to give out the office address of a business currently using the address.

all code, images, information sourced from other sites and people are used for learning purposes and are not being used for comercial use.
