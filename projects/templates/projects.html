        <p>The General support will be used to provide all the stuff needed to support the basic living needs such as food, clothing, medication
        transport funds for getting to interviews and classes for those who want to have a better life. unfortunatly we can't house every homeless
        person in which case some of the general support funds will go to providing food and blankets to those still living on the streets.</p>
